# Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems

In order to evaluate which type of intelligent agent would thrive in
a competitive setting, we adapted a famous arcade game
called Bomberman, where we matched different types of
agents against each other. With our approach, we aimed to compare
the behavioral performance of different agent types using a set of
empirical metrics to be able to understand which one was the most
suitable for the task.
